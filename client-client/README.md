# mpc-hello (client <> client)

This is a template repository designed to be the hello-world of
[mpc-framework](https://github.com/voltrevo/mpc-framework).

It uses [summon](https://github.com/voltrevo/summon) for circuit generation
and [emp-wasm-backend](https://github.com/voltrevo/emp-wasm-backend) for
secure 2PC.

It's a minimal web app where users can make 1-to-1 connections with each other
and compute the larger of two numbers.

Hosted on github pages: https://voltrevo.github.io/mpc-hello/.

- 250 sloc
- Simple frontend
- P2P end-to-end encrypted communication
- Circuit code included via ordinary project files

Below are other examples of mpc-hello applications you may want to explore:

- [**Client-Server**](../client-server)
- [**Server-Server**](../server-server)
- [**MPC-Hello with Next.js**](../next-js)

## Running Locally

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Updating the Percentage Display

The percentage display works using a constant `TOTAL_BYTES` and comparing this to the number of
bytes sent and received:
```ts
const TOTAL_BYTES = 248476;
```

When you change the circuit, this number needs to be changed to calculate the correct percentages.
To do this, add a log when `totalBytesRef.current` is updated:

```ts
totalBytesRef.current += msg.byteLength;                     // Note: there are two of these
console.log('Total bytes exchanged', totalBytesRef.current); // Add this line in both places
```

Run your app, note the highest value logged, and update `TOTAL_BYTES` to this value.
